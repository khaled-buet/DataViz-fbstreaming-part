Bei Facebook scheinen im Callcenter nur noch Türken zu sitzen,die kritische Anmerkungen an Erdogan und Türkei blockieren.Sind wir schon soweit, das wir Informelle Mirarbeiter von Erdogan in Deutschland haben. Hat dann Pegida nicht recht die uns warnen vor einer Islaiesierumg.Heute der Kommentar im Radio Multir hat eine Türkin, auf Infame Weise uns alle Deutschen als Rassisten bezeichnet.Hat Pegida recht ?Ich kann ohne weiteres auf Facebook verzichten, aber müssen wir uns das von Türkischen Rassisten gefallen lassen?

FEDERER'S LIST
Head to head!
The 8th and 9th wonders of the world?
SAIL
The sail  goes white  lonely
In a fog of the sea  blued!
What does he search in the country far?
What has he thrown in the native edge?

The waves plays - a wind whisper,
And the mast bend and scratch...
Alas! He does not search the happiness
And not runs from the happiness!

Under him the stream is lighter an azure,
Over him the beam of the golden sun...
And he,the rebellious, asks a storms,
As though in storms there is a rest!

Hint: Prophet Mohammad is the best Muslim, no Muslim can be as perfect as he was, Muslims try their best to be the typical Muslim like Prophet Mohammad PBUH but sometimes they disobey God and Prophet Mohammad PBUH as they are normal humans who are subject to do wrong but the repent and get back to the right path.

SUPPORT A WORLDWIDE TRANSITION TO A RESOURCE BASED ECONOMY

Founded in 2008, The Zeitgeist Movement is a sustainability advocacy organization, which conducts community based activism and awareness actions through a network of global/regional chapters, project teams, annual events, media and charity work.

The movement's principle focus includes the recognition that the majority of the social problems that plague the human species at this time are not the sole result of some institutional corruption, absolute scarcity, a political policy, a flaw of "human nature" or other commonly held assumptions of causality. Rather, the movement recognizes that issues such as poverty, corruption, pollution, homelessness, war, starvation and the like appear to be "symptoms" born out of an outdated social structure.

While intermediate reform steps and temporal community support are of interest to the movement, the defining goal is the installation of a new socioeconomic model based upon technically responsible resource management, allocation and design through what would be considered the scientific method of reasoning problems and finding optimized solutions.

This “Natural Law/Resource-Based Economy" (NLRBE) is about taking a direct technical approach to social management as opposed to a monetary or even political one. It is about updating the workings of society to the most advanced and proven methods known, leaving behind the damaging consequences and limiting inhibitions. which are generated by our current system of monetary exchange, profit, business and other structural and motivational issues.

The movement is loyal to a train of thought, not figures or institutions. The view held is that through the use of socially targeted research and tested understandings in science and technology, we are now able to logically arrive at societal applications that could be profoundly more effective in meeting the needs of the human population, increasing public health. There is little reason to assume war, poverty, most crime and many other monetarily-based scarcity effects common in our current model cannot be resolved over time. The range of the movement's activism and awareness campaigns extend from short to long term, with methods based explicitly on non-violent methods of communication.

The Zeitgeist Movement has no allegiance to country or traditional political platforms. It views the world as a single system and the human species as a single family and recognizes that all countries must disarm and learn to share resources and ideas if we expect to survive in the long run. Hence, the solutions arrived at and promoted are in the interest to help everyone on Earth, not a select group.
